The global reference system is defined by latitude and longitude and is the reference system used by the GPS and in maps.\n\n\n\n\nThe acoustic reference system  (the x and y axis) is defined by the orientation of the housing. The housing is by definition located in origin (x=0, y=0).  A label on top of the lid indicates the x-y coordinate system. The position of the receivers and the search area are specified in the Acoustic reference system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines\n\n\nYou can in principle place the receivers at any location within 100m from the origin of the acoustic reference system. In order to ensure the best performance, you should follow a few guidelines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine-of-sight\n\n\nTry to place the receivers so they all have a free line-of-sight to the Locator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Separation\n\n\nThe system performs better when there is a large distance between the \n receivers. More separation is better, but 2x2 meters is sufficient for good\n performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Range\n\n\nThere should be maximum 100m from any receiver to the Locator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiver depth\n\n\nPlace the receivers at a few meters depth. Near the surface there are typically \nsmall air bubbles caused by waves. These small air bubbles attenuate the \nacoustic signal and can reduce the system performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit search area\n\n\nYou will get a better position if you help the search algorithm to narrow the \nsearch area. Limit the search range setting to the area where the Locator is \nexpected to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectivity\n\n\nThe Receivers have less sensitivity in backward direction (where cable enters). \nAlso, the Locator has less acoustic gain in the direction of the cable entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiver stability\n\n\nAdd some weight to the receivers so they hang straight down in the water\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn board GPS\n\n\nIf the master electronics is static during operation it is recommended to use the \nstatic option for the GPS. This is to remove the inaccuracy of the GPS receiver \nin global position. Only use onboard GPS when the reference system is moving \neg. if mounted to a boat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoat Example\n\n\nThe illustration bellow shows a typical receiver configuration when installed on a boat. The receivers are hanging from the side of the boat, one in each corner. The depth of the receivers are typically 2-4m, deep enough to get below the hull and get free line-of-sight to the Locator. Notice how the housing defines the origin and coordinate system of the acoustic reference system.\n\n\n\n\nGPS\n\n\nThe on-board GPS module is used to position the system in a global reference system. An external antenna with integrated amplifier is used to improve GPS reception. The signal strength of the GPS can be seen on the top bar in the web GUI.\n\n\nGPS-antenna assembly\n\n\nThe GPS-antenna can be mounted anywhere you want, but remember the GPS-antenna is the origin of the master electronics position. Therefor it is recommended to fasten the antenna on the lid of the pelican case. With the 3M double sided tape, attach the GPS- antenna to the lid of the pelican case.\n\n\n\n\nConnect the GPS-antenna cable to the SMA connector on the master electronics. Torque the SMA nut to 3\u20135 in\u00b7lbf (0.3 to 0.6 N\u00b7m) or slightly more than finger tight.\n\n\n\n\nIMU\n\n\nThe master electronics has an built in IMU used to provide the orientation of the master electronics. This is used in combination with the acoustic position and GPS to generate the global position of the Locator.\n\n\nIMU Calibration\n\n\nFor the IMU to work properly it needs to be calibrated. The calibration data is stored when full calibration is obtained for faster calibration on restart of the system. If the system is started on a new location a new calibration is needed for the IMU to work as intended. \n\n\nTo calibrate the IMU disconnect all Recivers and Locator cables, but leave power and Ethernet connected. While looking at the top bar in the web GUI on the IMU status bar move the pelican case in a figure of 8 until all the bars are green.",
