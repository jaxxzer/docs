When a Receiver-D1 or Locator-D1 cable is connected to the master board, the corresponding LED should be continuously ON. The silkscreen marking of the channel LEDs on the PCB are 0-indexed. The channel labels on the housing are 1-index. We thus get following LED channel mapping:     Interface  LED      Receiver, channel 1  0    Receiver, channel 2  1    Receiver, channel 3  2    Receiver, channel 4  3    Locator-D1  6         The LED on the Locator-A1 interface is not in use.",
